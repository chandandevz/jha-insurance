                            <p>Our risk management process begins with continuous assessment and identification of
                                potential risks across multiple domains, including market, operational, and underwriting
                                risks. By proactively monitoring changes in regulatory frameworks, economic conditions,
                                and industry trends, we can anticipate and respond to potential challenges. This ongoing
                                evaluation enables us to implement timely strategies that mitigate risks before they impact
                                our operations.

                                solutions. By transferring a portion of our risk to reinsurers, we effectively mitigate the
                                potential losses that may arise from high claims events. This approach not only protects our
                                balance sheet but also allows us to underwrite more substantial policies with confidence,
                                knowing that we have a safety net in place.

                                management capabilities. Jha Insurance utilizes advanced analytics and predictive modeling
                                tools to assess and manage risks more efficiently. By analyzing historical data and current
                                trends, we can better predict potential claims and streamline our claims management
                                processes. This technological integration not only improves operational efficiency but also
                                enhances the overall customer experience by enabling faster claims resolution.</p><br>
